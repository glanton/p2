###Project Desc

Project 2 (p2): xkcd password generator. This is a password generator based on the xkcd comic Password Strength. It will generate passwords using between 1 and 5 words, and also provides the option to include a random number, a random special character, and CamelCase. I just added a small update post-submission: The form will now save your previous settings so that you can quickly make a new password if you don't like the one you got.

###Demo Info

I will demo in-person.

### Additional Info

Credit goes to xkcd, but beyond that no additional sources were used. The application itself, I hope, should be friendly and self-explanatory!
